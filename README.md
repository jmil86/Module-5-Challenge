Pymaceuticals Analysis

Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective drugs, demonstrating significantly smaller tumor volumes compared to the other treatments. Ketapril, on the other hand, was the least effective, resulting in larger tumor growth. Weight was a strong predictor of tumor size, with heavier mice consistently exhibiting larger tumors. This suggests that weight may play a role in tumor development and progression.
